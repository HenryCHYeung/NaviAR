Every semester, new students and faculty arrive at the NYIT Manhattan campus. Navigating a sprawling college campus can be a daunting task, especially when trying to find specific buildings and rooms. For newcomers, this may get confusing very quickly. While asking the security desk for directions is usually the normal approach, this can prove to be a hassle as security is already swamped with tasks, such as checking student ID and helping others already on line. To simplify this experience and enhance campus orientation, we proudly present our innovative solution: the Augmented Reality (AR) Waypoint Guide for College Campus Buildings.
